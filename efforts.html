    <h1>My Efforts for You</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>I've lost my self-respect, but it was worth it for you.</li>
      <li>I've controlled my anger to maintain peace between us.</li>
      <li>I have adjusted and compromised every time, even when it was tough.</li>
      <li>Even when you cheated, I tried to forgive and work through it.</li>
      <li>I've learned to communicate better for us to be happy together.</li>
      <li> I waited for him to realize my worth, even when it felt hopeless.</li>
      <li> I gave him space when he needed it, even when I needed him the most.</li>
      <li>I stayed strong for us, even when I was breaking inside.</li>
      <li> I never let go of him, no matter how much he pushed me away.</li>
    </ul>
